1. I wanted to make a game that was more fun than any smaller game I've made in the past. My goals going into this games was to make something that
someone who played video games who know how to play. Console apps are not that fun and can often seem boring to people who don't code or know 
much about gaming history. I struggled a lot doing the maze lab and wanted to show I learned a lot doing that. My ultimate aspiration was to make 
a game that looked fun and a user who knew nothing about code would enjoy playing.
2. This project was intresting to me because i really enjoy making games. In my free time I love playing video games and learning about gaming  
history. I want to have made a wholly orginal game where I came up with all the ideas.
3. I wanted to make a boss arena fight. I tried to think out of the box for how to make a different type of gameplay. I wanted a whole new game   
mechanic so I created a random number generator that took a certain amount of health from the boss depending on how much stuff you gained in the previous areas. I was really proud that I made two seperate gamestates that a player could play. 
4. I learned a lot in this project. I learned how to use loops better than I have before.
